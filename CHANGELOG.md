# Changelog

All notable changes to WordWise Korean will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **Chinese & Japanese translations**: All 6,064 vocabulary words now have full 中文 and 日本語 translations — select your language in the popup

### Improved
- **Popup redesign**: Dark theme matching the extension's brand — cleaner layout, better readability
- **Translation quality**: English, Chinese, and Japanese translations reviewed and refined across the full vocabulary (verbose phrases shortened, near-synonyms deduplicated, parentheticals removed)

## [0.1.2] - 2026-02-20

### Added
- **New Extension Icon**: Redesigned icon — clean bold W on a purple gradient, replacing the original book/한 design
- **Expanded Vocabulary**: 4,341 → **6,065 words**
  - TOPIK I: 1,578 words (unchanged)
  - TOPIK II: 2,729 → **4,487 words** (+1,725 new words, duplicates removed)
- **Cleaner Translations**: English translations are now trimmed for display — parenthetical notes, unit markers (`~ piece(s)`, `~ minute(s)`), and near-synonyms (`autumn, fall` → `autumn`) are removed automatically

### Fixed
- **Wrong annotations on verb forms**: Words like `살았어요`, `배우니까`, `서고`, `서는`, `해요` now correctly resolve to their verb (`살다`, `배우다`, `서다`, `하다`) instead of a same-spelled noun
- **Numbers before Korean no longer annotated**: `1심`, `2층`, `3복` etc. are skipped
- **Extension crash on first level switch**: No longer crashes when switching level immediately after a fresh install
- **Translation cleanup**: Removed verbose `to`/`to be`/`being` prefixes and resolved ~1,500 conflicting entries from the vocabulary expansion

### Known Issues
- `가서` (가다 + ㅏ-contraction) produces no annotation

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- **Font Size Control**: New slider in popup to adjust translation text size (80%-150%)
  - Real-time updates without page reload
  - Optimized to only update CSS, no re-annotation needed
  - Preference saved across all websites
- **Better Readability**: Increased default annotation font size from 0.5em to 0.6em (20% larger)
  - Much more readable in emails and pages with small text
  - Better visibility on high-resolution screens

### Changed
- **Simplified Language Options**: Hidden Chinese and Japanese options in popup
  - Only English available currently (others are placeholders)
  - Added note: "Chinese & Japanese translations coming soon!"
  - Reduces user confusion about unavailable features

### Technical
- Dynamic font size injection based on user preference
