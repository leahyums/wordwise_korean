## 🔧 For Developers

### Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pnpm install
# or npm install / yarn install
```

2. **Start development mode**:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will:
- Build the extension
- Open Chrome with the extension loaded
- Watch for changes and auto-reload

### Running Tests
```bash
pnpm test          # Run all tests
pnpm test:watch    # Watch mode during development
```

Tests cover translation precision, vocabulary data integrity, Korean stem matching, and POS-aware collision resolution.

### Debugging
- Open extension popup and check console: Right-click → Inspect
- Content script logs: Open page console (F12)
- Background script: `chrome://extensions` → Details → Inspect views

Test on live Korean sites:

## ️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [WXT](https://wxt.dev/) - Modern extension development
- **UI**: Vue 3 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Native CSS with ruby tag support
- **Build**: Vite
- **Manifest**: V3 (Chrome/Edge/Firefox compatible)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Extension not working?

1. Check if extension is enabled in popup
2. Refresh the page after changing settings
3. Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console)

### Annotations not appearing?

- Make sure the page contains Korean text (Hangul characters)
- Verify vocabulary level includes the words
- Check if the site is using unsupported elements (SVG, Canvas)

### Performance issues?

- Reduce vocabulary level to decrease processing
- The extension uses debouncing (500ms) for dynamic content
- Some sites with heavy dynamic updates may experience slight delays

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [x] Expand vocabulary to TOPIK I + II
- [x] Handle Korean verb/adjective conjugations
- [x] Filter common grammar particles
- [x] Translation quality pass (concise, no verbose prefixes, synonym dedup, tilde-description stripping)
- [x] Fix stem-matching collisions (살/살다, 배우/배우다, 서/서다, 해요/하다) — POS-aware two-pass lookup
- [x] Fix digit-compound annotation (1심, 2층, etc.)
- [x] Add Chinese and Japanese translations via Azure OpenAI batch translation
- [ ] Add more vocabulary
